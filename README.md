Capstone project of the of the Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization on Coursera:
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Ever wonder how Netflix decides what movies to recommend for you? Or how Amazon recommends books? This course project demontrates how it works by building a simplified recommender in Java!

This capstone aims to show off problem solving and Java programming skills by creating recommender systems. It will work with data for movies, including ratings, but the principles involved can easily be adapted to books, restaurants, and more. The program should be written to answer questions about the data, including which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies. Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, the recommender program should be able to:

1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
2. Calculate average ratings;
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings. 
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
